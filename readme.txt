This report I had prepared for the technical assessment as Naos BlockChain capital.


I have prepared this report in a rush so there might be misinterpretation of data.

1) I have consider two rows from ce2019_nac.csv as average salary I consider A747A as average salary for operational worker and A748A as average salary for administrative workers, I found those columns from diccionario_de_datos_ce2019.csv (now i would refer it as main dataset). 

2) Now, for region of mexico, I counsider tc_entidad_municipio.csv this file but unfortunately in main dataset MUNICIPIO column was empty so i had to use different column so for that I used tc_estrato_ce2019.csv file which divide mexico in four and which had mutual column in main dataset and tc_entidad_municipio.csv

3) now for the income groups, first I tried to divided in four categories, but then I looked at the website that was provied and on that 7 income groups were given so I did that but I believe that my method of dividing might be different than their method so intrepretations is different and I do not know how they divide in 7 categories.

4) I was trying to find correaltion but because of time contrains I was not able to do that.

5) My intrepretations might inaccurate because I was struggling to work with the given dataset since it was tottaly in spanish,but I expect that i would develop skill to work on this kind of data with time.

6) If you are not satisfied with my work then I would appreciate the opportunity to be assessed again with a different dataset, and i request that datasets to be in English if possible otherwise I would give my best on whichever work you give.

7) I spent around 12 hours to prepare this report, I wished i could have given more hours but I had mids on thursday and friday so i was not able to put all my efforts If i had more time i would have tried to find better relationships between different coulmns and datasets.
